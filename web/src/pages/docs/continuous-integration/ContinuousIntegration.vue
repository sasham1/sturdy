        Sturdy has first-party integrations with popular CI/CD tools like Buildkite, and also
        supports bringing in existing CI/CD integrations via the GitHub integration.
      </p>

      <h2>Supported CI/CD providers</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Buildkite</li>
        <li>GitHub Actions</li>
        <li>Circle CI <sup>*</sup></li>
        <li>Jenkins <sup>*</sup></li>
        <li>TeamCity Bamboo <sup>*</sup></li>
        <li>Travis CI <sup>*</sup></li>
        <li>... and many more! <sup>*</sup></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <em><sup>*</sup> via Sturdy for GitHub</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Pre-merge testing</h2>

      <p>
        Pre-merge testing are the tests that you execute <em>before</em> merging a Draft on Sturdy.
        Usually this is a list of faster tests and linters that you never want to break.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        <router-link :to="{ name: 'resourcesMigrateFromGitHub' }"
          >Sturdy integrates with GitHub
        </router-link>
        . Any Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery providers you use that report to GitHub
        will also have its status be reported in the Sturdy UI.
      </p>

      <h2>Running CI/CD Pipelines</h2>
      <p>
        If you have your codebase
        <router-link :to="{ name: 'resourcesMigrateFromGitHub' }"
          >hooked up with GitHub
        </router-link>
        , Sturdy will occasionally export changes to the corresponding repository on GitHub,
        depending on the integration/migration phase you're using.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If you're using
          <router-link
            :to="{ name: 'resourcesMigrateFromGitHub', hash: '#github-as-source-of-truth' }"
            >GitHub as the source of truth
          </router-link>
          , changes you're making in Sturdy will be upstreamed to GitHub via pull requests. Every
          time you create or update a PR via Sturdy, the checks that are configured on the GitHub
          side will be run.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you're using
          <router-link
            :to="{ name: 'resourcesMigrateFromGitHub', hash: '#sturdy-as-source-of-truth' }"
            >Sturdy as the source of truth
          </router-link>
          , changes that are shared from a draft change and added to the changelog will be committed
          to the default branch on the GitHub repository. This, in turn, will run any workflows
          configured in GitHub.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Feedback in Sturdy</h2>
      <p>
        Whichever way you do it, Sturdy will report the status of the CI/CD runs directly in the UI.
        On all pages where entries from the changelog are shown, the status of the pipeline for each
        change will be added.
      </p>

        <figcaption>
          On the top of the codebase page, the list of latest changes will be complemented with a
          status icon indicating the result of any CI/CD workflow.
