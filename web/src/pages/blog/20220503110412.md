# Sturdy v1.8.0

Hey ducklings (that's you, all Sturdy fans!)

Sturdy v1.8.0 is just _fresh of the compiler_ and we'd like to share all of the goodies in this new release.

The [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sturdy-dev/sturdy/blob/api/v1.8.0/CHANGELOG.md) contains a condensed list of everything that's new, but in this post we're digging deeper into all of the new features and improvements.

## Undo and redo

Behind the scenes, Sturdy has been been operating on "snapshots" for a while now. It's what's powering all of our drafts, and for example powers the automatic store and restore of changes when you're jumping between drafts.

Snapshots are a stored in a linked list, where each draft has a "head" snapshot, that in turn can have a "parent" snapshot (this becomes important later).

Sturdy automatically creates snapshots in the background when you're coding (or really, when we detect changes to files on your filesystem), and when you're doing manual actions to a draft through the UI (such as undoing a file).

The new undo/redo functionality operates entirely on the snapshots, and exposes them to the user.
